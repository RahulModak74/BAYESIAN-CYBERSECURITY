Bayesian Traffic-Prism: Open-Source Web Security for All


üåü Vision
At Bayeian Traffic-Prism , our mission is to democratize cybersecurity by providing enterprise grade open-source, transparent, and neutral tools that empower individuals, organizations, and governments to defend against evolving web-based threats. We believe that cybersecurity is a shared responsibility, and our platform bridges the gap between traditional WAFs and modern attack vectors like DOM-based XSS, session hijacking, and bot attacks.

Our ultimate goal is to become the "Hugging Face of Cybersecurity" ‚Äîa global, community-driven initiative that fosters collaboration, innovation, and trust in the fight against cybercrime.

üöÄ What is Traffic-Prism?
Traffic-Prism is an adaptive, AI-powered web application firewall (WAF) designed to complement existing WAFs like Nginx firewall, ModSecurity and DDoS  FastNetMon. It provides advanced features such as:

DOM-Based Attack Detection : Protects against modern client-side vulnerabilities like DOM XSS, DOM SQLi, and Clickjacking.
Session Intelligence : Monitors user sessions in real-time, calculating risk scores to identify and terminate risky sessions automatically.
Bayesian Risk Inference(Optional-Consulting) : Combines historical pattern analysis with Gen AI-based scoring to detect zero-day attacks and sophisticated threats.
Bot Detection : Identifies and mitigates sophisticated bots t and automated browser attacks using Playwright/Selenium.
Power BI Analytics(Part of consulting) : Offers detailed forensic data and real-time reporting for vulnerability analysis and incident response.
Traffic-Prism is a natural upgrade path for 100,000+ ModSecurity installations , bringing them on par with market-leading WAFs while remaining fully open-source. We will have commercial support, generative AI module and power bi based advanced reporting for corporates who need support turnaround commitment.
