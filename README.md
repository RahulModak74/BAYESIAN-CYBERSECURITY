# Bayesian Traffic-Prism: Open-Source Web Security for All

## ⚠️ Disclaimer

## 🌟 Vision
At Bayesian Traffic-Prism our vision is quality cybersecurity should be free. Our mission is to democratize cybersecurity by providing enterprise grade open-source, transparent, and neutral tools that empower individuals, organizations, and governments to defend against evolving web-based threats. We believe that cybersecurity is a shared responsibility, and our platform bridges the gap between traditional WAFs and modern attack vectors like DOM-based XSS, session hijacking, and bot attacks.

Our ultimate goal is to become the "Hugging Face of Cybersecurity" —a global, community-driven initiative that fosters collaboration, innovation, and trust in the fight against cybercrime.

## 🚀 What is Traffic-Prism?
Traffic-Prism is an adaptive, AI-powered web application firewall (WAF) designed to complement existing WAFs like Nginx firewall, ModSecurity and DDoS FastNetMon. It provides advanced features such as:

- **DOM-Based Attack Detection**: Protects against modern client-side vulnerabilities like DOM XSS, DOM SQLi, and Clickjacking.
- **Session Intelligence**: Monitors user sessions in real-time, calculating risk scores to identify and terminate risky sessions automatically.
- **Bayesian Risk Inference** (Optional-Consulting): Combines historical pattern analysis with Gen AI-based scoring to detect zero-day attacks and sophisticated threats.
- **Bot Detection**: Identifies and mitigates sophisticated bots and automated browser attacks using Playwright/Selenium.

## 🔒 Security Considerations
- Traffic-Prism is designed to enhance web security but cannot guarantee protection against all threats.
- Security is a layered approach; Traffic-Prism should be one component of your overall security strategy.
- Regular security audits and updates to your entire infrastructure are still necessary.
- Users are responsible for proper configuration and implementation within their environments.

## 📜 License
Traffic-Prism is licensed under dual license - Server Side Public License (SSPL) and Commercial one. SSPL license ensures that:

- Anyone can use, modify, and distribute the software freely.
- If you offer Traffic-Prism as a service (e.g., SaaS), you must also open-source your entire stack under the SSPL.
- This protects the platform from being used without contributing back to the community.

For more details, see the LICENSE file. For end users we don't foresee any impact and they can freely use for their internal defenses.

Even if you are a hosted website like WordPress you can still host and avail this platform to track bots and prevent DOM XSS attacks.
